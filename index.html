                                       the last 40 miles from the San Gabriel Mountains to the ocean. It passes through the Whittier Narrows Natural Area, The Natural Area has 
                                       over 300 species of birds, two Endangered, others Threatened and of Special Concern. It was described by a local woman whose family did 
                                       not travel for vacations as, “My Yosemite.” A young local man said when he visited, he was in awe to see more than one tree together like a 
                                       forest. Before that, he had only seen a tree in a person’s yard. Local people had grown up visiting this little piece of natural area, open space, 
                                       with their families. The location has hosted innumerable field trips for schools and groups like Boy Scouts. It is the location of Mexican American history. 
                                       It is the first Audubon center west of the Mississippi. The core area was set aside by the National Audubon Society as a preserve in 1939. It is an outdoor

                                       replace it with a mega building complex, the (DC). The project would eliminate dozens of trees for the preferred option, a 20,000 square foot main building with a

                                        Among the initial people recruited by Grace Allen were a university professor biologist, nature center volunteers including local bird expert, Ed Barajas. In September 2006 
                                        we participated in the Scoping Meeting for the DC, a requirement of the California Environment Quality Act. At first, what became Friends of the Whittier Narrows Natural 
                                        Area was an informal group. But in 2007 we thought we needed a law-suit to stop them and then had to raise funds for it. In August of 2007, we formed the nonprofit 501(c) 
                                        3 Friends of Whittier Narrows Natural Area (Friends).</p>

                                            and went to city council meetings. We spoke at schools and intervened at public meetings. In 2015 we held informational pickets. On several “Earth Days”, we set up tables where we 
                                            presented information about protecting the natural area from the DC excesses. On one public Earth Day at the Sanitation District public area officials threatened us and told us to leave. 
                                            We informed them of our free speech rights and stayed. The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles was a member of the DC. We participated in events directed at public health, including one at 
                                            the natural area on the danger of mosquitos in wetlands by an insect vector specialist. The DC planned to build a shallow “demonstration wetland,” a potential mosquito breeding area adjacent to 
                                            the planned main meeting building, and “outdoor classroom” for children. We also assisted in a San Gabriel River clean-up cosponsored by other groups.</p>

                                                From 2007 and 2008 the Significant Ecological Area Technical Advisory Committee (SEATAC) of the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning met several times on whether or not to recommend the DC project. SEATAC members are professional biologists. On May 5, 2008, SEATAC voted not to recommend the project. We understood that Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina would abide by their decision. The Whittier Narrows Natural Area is the First District, her district. The DC had thought they were going to win this; they had thought it a perfunctory step and one they had assured themselves had an outcome in their favor. In July of 2009, there were the CEQA hearings at the South El Monte High School. We hired a lawyer, Marcia Wertenberger. Throughout this period we were going to DC board meetings regularly. We began to video the meetings and post excerpts of them to our YouTube channels. It was a good idea because they could not dispute recorded information for the public to see.

                                  SOUTH EL MONTE HIGH SCHOOL AND RIO HONDO STUDENTS From the beginning, we had participation from Rio Hondo students. The high school had formed the Emerald Necklace club on campus and developed a petition against the DC’s development at WN. The petition signed by the students was presented to a public meeting of the DC.

                                     GABRIELENO BAND OF MISSION INDIANS KIZH NATION (Kizh) In 2010 the Kizh became part of the efforts to save their sacred land at Whittier Narrows. On January 20, 2010 the DC voted to build their second largest alternative: a 14,000 sq ft facility and 114 space parking lot. In the vote they recognized destruction of existing natural area, affecting endangered birds, use of more global water, and contributing to climate change. Their rationalization was that it was more “important for the children.” We began our CEQA suit. In 2011 we submitted a petition against the DC signed by 1100 people to the DC (See YouTube video.). During this time the DC was setting up unannounced presentations meetings at city council, school board and campuses meetings, unannounced, so that Friends could not intervene. But, we found out about many anyway because we kept tabs on the internet announcements posted at the last minute.

                                     Among the initial people recruited by Grace Allen were a university professor biologist, nature center volunteers including local bird expert, Ed Barajas. In September 2006 
                                     we participated in the Scoping Meeting for the DC, a requirement of the California Environment Quality Act. At first, what became Friends of the Whittier Narrows Natural 
                                     Area was an informal group. But in 2007 we thought we needed a law-suit to stop them and then had to raise funds for it. In August of 2007, we formed the nonprofit 501(c) 
                                     3 Friends of Whittier Narrows Natural Area (Friends).</p>
                                     <p class=" para-desc mx-auto mb-0">During these years, Friends continued to provide information to the community. Friends organized at the natural area. We organized art shows, poetry readings, community picnics, 
                                         and went to city council meetings. We spoke at schools and intervened at public meetings. In 2015 we held informational pickets. On several “Earth Days”, we set up tables where we 
                                         presented information about protecting the natural area from the DC excesses. On one public Earth Day at the Sanitation District public area officials threatened us and told us to leave. 
                                         We informed them of our free speech rights and stayed. The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles was a member of the DC. We participated in events directed at public health, including one at 
                                         the natural area on the danger of mosquitos in wetlands by an insect vector specialist. The DC planned to build a shallow “demonstration wetland,” a potential mosquito breeding area adjacent to 
                                         the planned main meeting building, and “outdoor classroom” for children. We also assisted in a San Gabriel River clean-up cosponsored by other groups.</p>

                                             From 2007 and 2008 the Significant Ecological Area Technical Advisory Committee (SEATAC) of the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning met several times on whether or not to recommend the DC project. SEATAC members are professional biologists. On May 5, 2008, SEATAC voted not to recommend the project. We understood that Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina would abide by their decision. The Whittier Narrows Natural Area is the First District, her district. The DC had thought they were going to win this; they had thought it a perfunctory step and one they had assured themselves had an outcome in their favor. In July of 2009, there were the CEQA hearings at the South El Monte High School. We hired a lawyer, Marcia Wertenberger. Throughout this period we were going to DC board meetings regularly. We began to video the meetings and post excerpts of them to our YouTube channels. It was a good idea because they could not dispute recorded information for the public to see.
